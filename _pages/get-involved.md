The Open Organization project welcomes contributors of all kinds.

Our community members have diverse backgrounds; they're people from a number of different of domains (consulting, education, non-profits, open source software development, and more) who possess varying levels of experience and technical proficiencies. They [play different roles](https://github.com/open-organization/governance/wiki/Community-Roles) in the Open Organization project. But they all:

- Consider themselves champions of open organizational values and principles, as outlined in the [Open Organization Definition](https://github.com/open-organization/open-org-definition),
- Care about the ways those values can help create better organizational experiences for everyone, and
- Enjoy working productively with others who feel the same way.
