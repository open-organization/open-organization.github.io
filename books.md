## Core volumes

### The Open Organization Field Guide
[*The Open Organization Field Guide*](https://opensource.com/open-organization/resources/field-guide) is a community-produced companion to [Jim Whitehurst's initial thoughts on the future of work, management, and leadership](https://www.redhat.com/en/explore/the-open-organization-book). The book collects cutting-edge ideas about the ways open source values are changing the ways we work, manage, and lead.

### The Open Organization Leaders Manual
[*The Open Organization Leaders Manual*](https://opensource.com/open-organization/resources/leaders-manual) is a handbook for anyone attempting to harness the power of openness to lead teams that are more transparent, agile, collaborative, and mission-driven.

### The Open Organization Workbook
[*The Open Organization Workbook*](https://opensource.com/open-organization/resources/workbook) features contributions from more than 30 managers, educators, technologists, consultants, and other experts, who offer concrete and actionable strategies for putting the principles of transparency, inclusivity, adaptability, collaboration, and community into practice.

## Guides

### The Open Organization Guide to IT Culture Change
In [*The Open Organization Guide to IT Culture Change*](https://opensource.com/open-organization/resources/culture-change), more than 25 contributors from open communities, companies, and projects offer hard-won lessons and practical advice for creating an open IT department—one that can deliver better, faster results and unparalleled business value.

### The Open Organization Guide for Educators
What if we could build classrooms, departments, or entire educational institutions on the same values that power open source communities? What if we let open organization principles—like transparency, inclusivity, adaptability, collaboration, and community—guide our experiments in transforming education? How might that change the ways educators prepare students for life in an increasingly open world? In [*The Open Organization Guide for Educators*](https://opensource.com/open-organization/resources/educators-guide), more than two dozen advocates for open education explore these important questions.

### The Open Organization Guide to Distributed Teamwork
**Now in development!** Distributed organizations are more common than they've ever been. And the challenges to working together at a distance have never been more pressing. Across all industries and geographies, teams are rethinking how they operate—and questioning fundamental assumptions about the nature of work. Open organizational principles—like transparency, inclusivity, adaptability, collaboration, and community—can catalyze high-performing teams anywhere, even (perhaps especially) when their members are far apart. *The Open Organization Guide to Distributed Teamwork* offers remote, distributed teams guide to the open principles and practices essential for building dynamic, inclusive, high-performing teams—no matter where their members happen to be.
