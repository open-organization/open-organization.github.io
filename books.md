# Books
The Open Organization community maintains a collaboratively written,  evolving library of materials for understanding, exploring, and building next-generation organizations. To download alternate formats, edit the books, translate an installment, or contribute to the series, join the [Open Organization community on GitHub](https://github.com/open-organization).

## Perspectives
Open Perspectives is a series of short, timely publications featuring voices from our community of experts on open organizational culture, design, and leadership as they explore what they consider the most pertinent and pressing issues facing modern organizations.

### Opening Up to Leadership Talent

## Guides
Guides are collaboratively written, multi-author works collecting numerous voices in conversation about a single topic.

What if we could build classrooms, departments, or entire educational institutions on the same values that power open source communities? What if we let open organization principles guide our experiments in transforming education? How might that change the ways educators prepare students for life in an increasingly open world? In [*The Open Organization Guide for Educators*](https://github.com/open-organization/open-org-educators-guide/raw/master/open_org_educators_guide_1_0_1.pdf), more than two dozen advocates for open education explore these important questions.
