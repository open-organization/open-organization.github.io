What if we could build classrooms, departments, or entire educational institutions on the same values that power open source communities? What if we let open organization principles guide our experiments in transforming education? How might that change the ways educators prepare students for life in an increasingly open world? In [*The Open Organization Guide for Educators*](https://opensource.com/open-organization/resources/educators-guide), more than two dozen advocates for open education explore these important questions.

### The Open Organization Guide to Distributed Teamwork
**Now in development!** Distributed organizations are more common than they've ever been. And the challenges to working together at a distance have never been more pressing. Across all industries and geographies, teams are rethinking how they operate—and questioning fundamental assumptions about the nature of work. Open organizational principles—like transparency, inclusivity, adaptability, collaboration, and community—can catalyze high-performing teams anywhere, even (perhaps especially) when their members are far apart. *The Open Organization Guide to Distributed Teamwork* offers remote, distributed teams guide to the open principles and practices essential for building dynamic, inclusive, high-performing teams—no matter where their members happen to be.
