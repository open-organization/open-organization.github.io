# About
The Open Organization is a community-driven project dedicated to exploring how open principles change the ways we work, manage, and lead.

Our community members study and share strategies for building organizational cultures on principles like transparency, adaptability, collaboration, inclusivity, and community.

## Our Commitments
We're committed to:

- **Learning.** We're researching open source values so we can better understand how they're influencing today's innovative organizational cultures, and we're always refining the "open organization" concept, differentiating or distinguishing it from seemingly similar approaches to management and leadership.
- **Helping.** We're a trusted resource for anyone interested in leveraging the power of open principles to improve their organizations.
- **Translating.** We explain community-specific vocabularies to general audiences seeking to understand the benefits of an open approach to management and leadership.
- **Engaging.** We draw others into productive dialogues and exploratory activities that illuminate the benefits of applying open thinking to organizational contexts.

## Our Methods
We do all this by:

- Publishing articles, books, and other resources exploring the nature of openness in contemporary organizations
- Exhibiting and speaking at industry and community-focused events
- Connecting with and interviewing innovative leaders, managers, and practitioners innovating in an open manner
- Maintaining a repository of high-quality, immediately accessible, vetted resources anyone can use to implement open principles in their teams or organizations

## Our Contributors
The Open Organization project welcomes contributors of all kinds.

Our community members have diverse backgrounds; they're people from a number of different of domains (consulting, education, non-profits, open source software development, and more) who possess varying levels of experience and technical proficiencies. They [play different roles](https://github.com/open-organization/governance/wiki/Community-Roles) in the Open Organization project. But they all:

- Consider themselves champions of open organizational values and principles, as outlined in the [Open Organization Definition](https://github.com/open-organization/open-org-definition),
- Care about the ways those values can help create better organizational experiences for everyone, and
- Enjoy working productively with others who feel the same way.
