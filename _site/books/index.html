Across all industries and geographies, teams are rethinking how they operate—and questioning fundamental assumptions about the nature of work. Open organizational principles—like transparency, inclusivity, adaptability, collaboration, and community—can catalyze high-performing teams anywhere, even (perhaps especially) when their members are far apart. <em>The Open Organization Guide to Distributed Teamwork</em> offers remote, distributed teams guide to the open principles and practices essential for building dynamic, inclusive, high-performing teams—no matter where their members happen to be. <a href="https://github.com/open-organization/open-org-distributed-work-guide">Contribute now!</a></p>
